Diablo 2 Resurrected assistive program

1. set your Diablo 2 Resurrected options to default brightness
2. set your Diablo 2 Resurrected to a 1280x720 window (the smallest it can go, just drag the bottom-right corner and shrink it
3. Make sure your character is at the top of the character list and in Hell act 5
4. Uses F5 for fireball, F6 for teleport, F7 for frozen orb and F8 for telekinesis
5. fill your inventory with charms, keep last 3 columns clear
6. make sure Diablo 2 Resurrected is showing on the primary display
7. do not have the clock showing in the top right, it's gold and triggers the unique item flag.
8. start the program!

The program clicks on Play, Hell, goes to the stash, drops items from the last 3 columns, then enters the anya portal,
teleports in and alternates F5 right clicks and F7 right clicks for a bit,
then tries to grab orange (rune), green (set) and gold (unique) items (and ends up stashing them)
